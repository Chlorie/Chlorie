About Myself
- PhD student at Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)
- Researching on **machine learning / data mining**
- Novice **C++** / **C#** user, feeling not so great about dynamic typed languages but sometimes has to use them to get jobs done
- Loves computer language features and quirks (I heard you say "template meta-programming"?)
- Personal side projects are started at a regular basis but seldom finished :(
- Really loves games, especially rhythm games (referring to mobile ones, didn't have the chance to play arcade games)
