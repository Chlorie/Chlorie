About Myself
- Ph.D. in Computer Science on Machine Learning and Data Mining.
- I like a variety of programming languages:
  - C++: It provides access to extreme performance while not sacrificing high level constructs or being overly restrictive. I like template meta-programming and want reflection yesterday.
  - Câ™¯: I like the ecosystem and all the syntax sugar. Discriminated unions when?
  - Python: This one I'm mostly using at work. I used to absolutely hate it, but now I'm kind of OK with it for its convenience to write simple scripts. Later I realized that the thing I hate is just badly written Python code with no type hints, lots of *"clever tricks"* that circumvents the type checker (like `(get|set)attr`), and passing `dict`s everywhere.
- I have a lot of short-lived, not even half-finished side projects. One day I'll certainly finish at least one of them ðŸ˜†
- I love playing games. Mainly rhythm games (e.g. Arcaea, Deemo, etc.), puzzle games (e.g. Baba is You, 14 Mainsweeper Variants), and some indies in other genres (e.g. Celeste). I'm not that into AAA titles.
