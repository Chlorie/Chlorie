About Myself
- **Ph.D. student** at Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
- Researching on **machine learning & data mining**.
- Novice programmer, especially **loves the C++ language**, also likes a few other languages like Câ™¯. I don't like dynamically typed languages very much *(cough Python cough)*, but sometimes I have to use them to get jobs done.
- Loves computer language features and quirks. (I heard you say "template meta-programming"?)
- Personal side projects are started at a regular basis ~~(mainly for procrastination)~~ but seldom finished... ðŸ˜¢
- I love playing games, mainly not the AAA kind, and more leaning towards indie games. I like rhythm games (e.g. Arcaea), puzzle games (e.g. Baba is You), and some indies in other genres (e.g. Celeste).
